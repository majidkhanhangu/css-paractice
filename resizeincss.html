        <h1>resize the div property of css</h1>
        <p>This CSS property allows the user to control the resizing of an element just by clicking or dragging the
            bottom right corner of the element

            This CSS property is used to define how an element is resizable by the user. It doesn't apply on the block
            or inline elements where overflow is set to visible. So, to control the resizing of an element, we have to
            set the overflow other than visible like (overflow: hidden or overflow: scroll).

            It is possible to resize the elements either in a horizontal or vertical direction or in both directions.
            After applying the resize property to an element, we can see a small triangular knob at the bottom right
            corner of the element. The user can drag the knob to enlarge the textarea in either vertical, horizontal, or
            in both directions.</p>
