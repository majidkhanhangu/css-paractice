    <h1>ALBERT EINSTEIN :</h1>
    <div id="box">
      “A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part
      limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
      feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion
      of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us,
      restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons
      nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by
      widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the
      whole of nature in its beauty.” ― Albert Einstein
