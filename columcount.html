      A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited
      in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as
      something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his
      consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to
      our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our
      task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of
      compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its
      beauty.” ― Albert EinsteinA human being is a part of the whole called by
