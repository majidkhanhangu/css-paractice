      <p>“This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of
            an intelligent and powerful Being...
            This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his
            dominion he is wont, to be called Lord God παντοκρατωρ or Universal Ruler.”
            ― Isaac Newton, The Principia : Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</p>
