        “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own
        reason for existence. <br>One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates
        the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of
        reality. <br>It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this
        mystery each day. <br>—"Old Man's Advice to Youth: 'Never Lose a Holy
        Curiosity.
        '" LIFE Magazine (2 May 1955) p. 64” ― <br>Albert Einstein
