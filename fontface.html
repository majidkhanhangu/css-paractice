      â€œThe important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own
      reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates
      the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvselous structure of reality.
      It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery
      each day.
